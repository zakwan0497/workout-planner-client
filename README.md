ChatGPT tips for front end React application:

In a front-end React application, you should focus on the src folder first. Here's why:

    1. Core Application Logic: The src folder contains the core application logic, including components, state management, and routing. It's the backbone of your application, so setting it up first is crucial.

    2. Development Flow: By building the src folder first, you establish the main structure and functionality of your app. This allows you to test and iterate on the application more effectively during development.

    3. Public Folder Usage: The public folder mainly contains static assets such as images, favicon, and the HTML template. These assets are important but secondary to the functionality provided by your React components and logic.

Recommended Steps:

    1. Set Up src Folder:

        - Components: Create your components and organize them logically.
        - State Management: Set up state management using Context API, Redux, or any other preferred method.
        - Routing: Define the routes if your application is using React Router or a similar library.
        - Styles: Implement styles using CSS, SASS, or CSS-in-JS solutions.

    2. Configure the public Folder:

        - Add any static assets your application needs.
        - Customize the index.html if necessary, adding metadata, links to stylesheets, or external scripts.

In 'src' folder, do these steps:

    1. App and Index Files:

        - index.js: This is the entry point of your application where you render the root component into the DOM.
        - App.js: This is the root component that will host your applicationâ€™s main structure, including routing and initial layout.

    2. Core Components:

        - Begin with creating some of the core components that will be used across multiple pages or other components. Examples include Header, Footer, Sidebar, etc. These components establish the basic layout and recurring elements of your application.

    3. Pages:

        - Create the main pages (views) of your application. These could be components like HomePage, AboutPage, ContactPage, etc. These components typically represent the main screens or routes of your app and will often utilize the core components you created earlier.

    4. Utilities and State Management:

        - Set up any utility functions or state management (like Context, Redux, etc.) that your components and pages will rely on. This ensures you have the necessary logic and state handling in place as you build out your components and pages.
